			<p class="ridge">Music production has been a passion of mine for roughly a year now. I have always loved music, I listen to it every single day. It was only a matter of time that I took the initiative to begin producing my own music.</p>
			<p class="ridge">I taught myself how to play guitar years ago. Although it was enjoyable, it didn't quite fulfill my desire for music creation, which is when I began to look into music production using <a href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a>.</p>
			<p class="ridge">FL Studio is a DAW software that allows one to use, organize and arrange different sound samples and plug-ins to create music. It definitely has a steep learning curve to it as there is an immense amount of features and tools to learn about.</p>
			<p class="ridge">I have recently been uploading my beats to SoundCloud. Currently I only do this as a hobby but I would love to be able to find a career in music production.</p>
			<p class="ridge">I thought about changing my major to something music related, but I feared it would turn my passion to work and I would begin to lose interest.</p>
			<p class="ridge">Since music is an art, I never rush beats. I only work on music when I am in the mood to. I find this is when I produce the best.</p>
			<p class="ridge">For those interested, you can check out some of my beats on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/beatsbydez">SoundCloud</a> and my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deztinybeats/">Instagram</a>.</p>
